# Anxiety, Depression and Stress Prediction Among College Students Using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict anxiety, depression, and stress levels among college students based on their responses to a psychological questionnaire.

## 📌 Project Overview

- 🔍 Goal: To detect early signs of mental health issues in students.
- 🧠 Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and more.
- 📊 Dataset: Survey data collected from students.
- 📈 Output: Predicts the mental health condition (Anxiety / Depression / Stress).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Flask (for web deployment, if applicable)
